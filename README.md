# Mettistech
A Minecraft Clone using the Godot Engine.

The name is derived from the Esperanto word "metiisteco", meaning "craftmanship".

In the «terrain» folder it's where the voxel generators reside. The idea is to have a script and scene for each of different algorithms to generate different kinds of terrain. But for now it's only different iterations of getting a voxel engine to work. Alpha was the first try and is garbage. Theta is a minimalist template for reference. Zeta is the current trial.
